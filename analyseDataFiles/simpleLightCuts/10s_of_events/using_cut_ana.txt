Using the cut_ana.cc script

The .cc file uses int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
which is not the usual C++ main of: int main(){

Thus when running the executable (./cut_ana) all components of the argument vector must be inputted.

From the .cc script: 
argv[1] = libraryfile1 - the .root file you wish to read the library file from
argv[2] = cut_number
argv[3] = pmt_cut_number

Thus one the file has been made using: make -B

The executable can be run by using a command of the form:

./cut_ana ../requiredfile.root cut_number pmt_cut_number

A very specific example used from the current directory was: ./cut_ana ../eventFiles_withTimings/10s_sn_randompos.root 2 8
